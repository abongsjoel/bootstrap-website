# Bootstrap Website

> A simple website I built while learning bootstrap

![screenshot](../features/screenshot.png)

In this project, I built a simple responsive website while learning how to use bootstrap. The page starts with a responsive navbar using the bootstrap navbar class; then a slideshow using the bootstrap carousel class. I also made use of the row and col classes to change the display of items depending on the screen sizes. I made use of a jumbotron around the end to create a call-to-action section.
